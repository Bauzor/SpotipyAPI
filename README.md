# SpotipyAPI

Welcome to my side project that uses the SpotipyAPI. For this project I plan on scraping user playlists to obtain 
information about a user's music and turning it into a dataset. Then I will perform all kinds of preprocessing on 
the data to predict 20 new songs a user may or may not like. In the future, I hope to be able to visualize music in 
a 3D space and allow users to explore a version of kNN using music. (The actual prediction will be in multi-dimensional 
space but for simplicity sake I will try to visualize it in R3)
